		 	<p>We are developing a learning platform where students and teachers can interact in much more free and meaningful ways then the ways in traditional teaching methods. The concept of a teacher and student is much more loose in the sense that anyone teaching anything is a teacher and anyone learning anything is a student. These loose meanings in teacher and student concepts allow us to create much more creative learning environments. </br> For more info please visit our <a href="https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group6/wiki">github page.</a> </p>
