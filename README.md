Welcome to CmpE 352 group project for the course **CmpE 352** offered at Bogazici
University in Spring 2016 semester. We are Group 6 and it is nice to have you
around here. Our project is about creating a learning platform where teachers
and students can engage in a creative, non-traditional learning experience. 


Our notion of teacher and student is different from that of traditional approach.
Every user of our platform will be a student. On the other hand, for being a teacher one is expected to sign up as a teacher in the first place. For more information, please refer
to our [Wiki page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group6/wiki)
to see what is currently going on such as our requirements, initial plan and
research topics.
